Re: sleep:  I figured that since we were thinking about that (and really any other analagous problems, e.g. noise, etc.) as 'how we would solve it in a place together?', that actually can be backported reasonably well to present day, e.g: move where cats get fed, extra white noise, some kind of extra partition, w/e, basic stuff like that.  Not everything can be altered but it's not a bad dry-run for then at least.

I hope all goes well, I miss you
