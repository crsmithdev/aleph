# Aleph Repository Instructions

## Project Overview
Aleph is a game engine with Vulkan backend, built with Rust and Slang.

## Coding Style Guidelines
- Write minimal code that is easy to read and understand.
- Use idiomatic Rust patterns and conventions.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction and complexity.
- Avoid small functions that are used < 2 times
- Use terse but descriptive names for types, functions, and variables.

## Code Modification Guidelines
- Make incremental changes that are easy to review.
- If changing many files, confirm changes for each file before proceeding.
- Do not make changes that are not strictly necessary for your task.
- Do not delete structures, functions, or methods without asking me.
- Do not comments to generated code.
